# Computer-Architecture

In this course, I will be learning the following concepts: Binary Representation, C (programming language), Memory Management, RISC-V, Synchronous Digital Systems (SDS), Datapath, The Memory Hierarchy, Parallelism, and Input/Output. The internal organization and operation of digital computers. 
Machine architecture, support for high-level languages (logic, arithmetic, instruction sequencing) and operating systems (I/O, interrupts, memory management, process switching). Elements of computer logic design. Tradeoffs involved in fundamental architectural design decisions.
