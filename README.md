# Computer Architecture

In this course, I will be learning the following concepts: 
* Binary Representation
* C (programming language) -- K&R 
* Memory Management
* RISC-V
* Synchronous Digital Systems (SDS)
* Datapath
* The Memory Hierarchy
* Parallelism
* Input/Output

The internal organization and operation of digital computers. 
\
\
Comprehending these elements and the tradeoffs in architectural design decisions helps in building robust, efficient, and scalable computing solutions.
